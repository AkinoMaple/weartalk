[How to Fxxk Weilei's Server (Chinese Simplified)](https://github.com/ShiSheng233/How_to_Fxxk_Weilei_s_Server/blob/master/README.md)
### Who is Wei Lei?
Wei Lei is a Chinese Android Developer(Maybe), he developed some useless and problematic APP, such as WearTalk(腕上聊天室) and PhoneTalk(掌上聊天室). He is a master of Chongqing University, he is so silly and pompous, he attacked many other developers.  
### What's wrong with WearTalk and PhoneTalk?
1. API does not follow any industry norms.  
2. Leaking user privacy.  
3. UI is s**t.  
4. Checking password on client and send the true password to client.(Hahaha)  
5. No data security measures.  
6. It runs illegally in China.
